# Strengths

1. **Distributed Version Control**: Git allows every user to have a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work and reducing dependency on a central server.
2. **Branching and Merging**: Git's branching model is lightweight and efficient, making it easy to experiment with new features and merge changes seamlessly.
